# lab3

The markup we chose for this lab is semantically correct in that our class names 
are intuitive regarding the purpose of them in the document. So for example,
classes of title, or location, or skill all denote what they describe as far
as the content for them goes. Also, the use of microformatting to display contact 
information correlates with the goal of writing markup that is semantically correct. Using the 
hCard microformat, we assign inituitive preset class names to common contact fields such
as address (adr) and telephone number (tel). This concept will be expanded upon in a later section.

There are a couple of
non-semantic elements that we ended up using to make it easier to style the webpage. 
We felt that formatting is a key aspect when it comes to writing resumes and so we intuituively
made a div class = "left" and "right" to be able to style these classes easier and format the 
document as a whole when it came to moving blocks left or right. This is especially
useful for mapping dates to experiences or education. We wanted to use divs because 
its a general block level element that we are familiar with and since its used 
to wrap sections of a document, we felt it would be especially applicable to our case
here.

The Use of hCard:

Michael Kokkatt: 
hCard is a microformat used to add semantic value to contact information in markup.
Its useful because it serves to standardize this information and have set 
tag names that make sense to the context of contact information fields
thus making it very machine readable. It follows a set convention making it very 
machine-friendly. For example, Google even parses hCard microformats of webpages
to further optimize search results. 

Shane Riggs:
The hCard microformat is used to organize contact information on a page. It standardizes
the contact information such as names, phone numbers and addresses so that they are 
more readily readable by a maching. This allows search engines to differentiate between 
this important information and the rest of the text on the page.
